# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to enhance fraud detection for e-commerce and bank transactions. By leveraging geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition, we seek to build robust fraud detection models that improve transaction security and reduce financial losses.

## Business Need

Adey Innovations Inc. specializes in financial technology solutions. Effective fraud detection systems are crucial for preventing financial losses, building customer trust, and enabling efficient real-time monitoring and reporting.

## Project Goals

1. Analyze and preprocess transaction data.
2. Engineer features to identify fraud patterns.
3. Build and train machine learning models for fraud detection.
4. Evaluate and improve model performance.
5. Deploy models for real-time fraud detection and continuous monitoring.

## Data and Features

### Datasets

- **Fraud_Data.csv**: E-commerce transaction data for identifying fraudulent activities.
- **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**: Maps IP addresses to countries.
- **creditcard.csv**: Bank transaction data curated for fraud detection analysis.

### Key Features

- `user_id`, `signup_time`, `purchase_time`, `purchase_value`, `device_id`, `source`, `browser`, `sex`, `age`, `ip_address`, `class`
- IP address ranges mapped to countries
- PCA-transformed features in `creditcard.csv`

## Learning Outcomes

### Skills

- Deploying machine learning models using Flask
- Containerizing applications with Docker
- Creating and testing REST APIs
- Developing end-to-end deployment pipelines
- Implementing scalable machine-learning solutions

### Knowledge

- Model deployment principles
- Best practices for REST APIs
- Benefits of containerization
- Real-time prediction serving techniques
- Security in API development

## Process and Implementation

### Data Analysis and Preprocessing

Handled missing values, cleaned data, and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and patterns.

### Merge Datasets for Geolocation Analysis

Converted IP addresses to integer format and merged datasets to include geolocation information.

### Feature Engineering

Created features such as transaction frequency, velocity, hour of day, and day of week to enhance fraud detection capabilities.

### Normalization and Scaling

Standardized numerical features for improved model performance.

### Encode Categorical Features

Applied one-hot encoding to transform categorical variables into numerical format.

## Conclusion

The project involved comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and initial steps for model deployment. The insights from EDA and the new features created enhance the dataset for better fraud detection. Future work will focus on building and evaluating machine learning models, deploying them for real-time detection, and setting up continuous monitoring and improvement processes.
